# ca65-mode

A very basic emacs major mode for the ca65 assembler.

**Note: Only handles 6502 instructions at the moment!**

This **only** handles syntax highlighting, if you want more features you might want to check out `asm-mode`, if you are here because `asm-mode` kept getting in your way, welcome!
